.py files from my PhD thesis

This source contains a plugin for Olex2, *NonSpherTests*, which can be used to perform *numerical nonspherical refinement*, and generate files for analysis, including files containing the design matrices as generated by various methods, as well as files containing the steps taken through a refinement process and details such as R-factor.

This source contains a file which can be run, *ns-analyse*, which evaluates the files generated by NonSpherTests and generates tables as used in my thesis. This code requires commenting and un-commenting lines to select which evaluations to perform and how to format them.

This also contains the raw *olex_twinning* code at the time of thesis submission. This is a file within olex2 which ships with olex2, but if needed to compare, my version is presented here. This is likely to become outdated over time.
